### Content Security Policy (CSP)

**1. Overview:**
   - **Purpose:** CSP is a security feature implemented to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks. It allows web developers to define which sources of content (scripts, styles, images, etc.) are considered trustworthy and can be loaded by the browser.

**2. How CSP Works:**
   - **Policy Definition:** CSP is defined using HTTP headers (`Content-Security-Policy`) or `<meta>` tags within HTML documents.
   - **Directive Structure:** CSP uses a directive-based structure where each directive specifies a particular type of content (e.g., scripts, styles) and the sources from which they can be loaded. Examples of directives include:
     - `default-src`: Specifies the default source for all content types.
     - `script-src`: Defines the allowed sources for JavaScript.
     - `style-src`: Defines the allowed sources for CSS.
     - `img-src`: Defines the allowed sources for images.
   - **Example Policy:** 
     ```http
     Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted.com; style-src 'self' https://trusted.com
     ```
     - This policy allows content to be loaded only from the site's origin (`'self'`) and `https://trusted.com` for scripts and styles.

**3. Benefits of CSP:**
   - **Mitigates XSS Attacks:** By restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded, CSP reduces the risk of malicious scripts being injected into a webpage.
   - **Prevents Clickjacking:** CSP can be used to prevent clickjacking attacks by controlling the framing of content.
   - **Reduces Attack Surface:** By specifying strict content sources, CSP minimizes the potential attack vectors available to attackers.

**4. Challenges and Considerations:**
   - **Inline Scripts and Styles:** CSP's strict rules might block inline scripts and styles, which could require refactoring of existing code to comply.
   - **Reporting:** CSP can be configured to send violation reports to a specified URL (`report-uri` directive), which can be useful for monitoring and tweaking the policy.
   - **Complexity:** Crafting an effective CSP policy can be complex, especially for sites with dynamic content or third-party integrations.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**1. Overview:**
   - **Purpose:** CSRF is an attack where an attacker tricks a user into executing unwanted actions on a web application where they are authenticated. This can lead to actions such as changing account details, transferring funds, or making purchases without the user's consent.

**2. How CSRF Works:**
   - **Attack Scenario:**
     1. The victim is logged into a website (e.g., a banking site) and has an active session.
     2. The attacker crafts a request that triggers a sensitive action on that site (e.g., money transfer).
     3. The attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious webpage, which automatically submits the crafted request to the target site using the victim's session (e.g., via an image tag or a hidden form).
     4. The target site processes the request as if it was legitimately made by the user, leading to unintended actions.

**3. Mitigating CSRF:**
   - **CSRF Tokens:** Use anti-CSRF tokens that are unique for each session or request. These tokens are included in forms and validated on the server side.
   - **SameSite Cookies:** Set the `SameSite` attribute on session cookies to `Strict` or `Lax`, preventing them from being sent with cross-origin requests.
   - **Double Submit Cookies:** A technique where a CSRF token is stored both in a cookie and as a form field, and the server compares the two values to validate the request.
   - **Referer Header Check:** Some implementations check the `Referer` or `Origin` header to ensure that the request originated from a trusted source.

**4. CSRF Example:**
   - Example attack URL:
     ```html
     <img src="https://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker" />
     ```
   - When a logged-in user visits the attacker's page, the image tag causes the request to be made to `bank.com`, transferring money to the attacker without the user's consent.

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**1. Overview:**
   - **Purpose:** SSRF is an attack where an attacker can force a server to make HTTP requests to an unintended and potentially malicious destination. This can lead to the server accessing internal systems or other resources that are not directly accessible by the attacker.

**2. How SSRF Works:**
   - **Attack Scenario:**
     1. The application allows users to input a URL that the server fetches (e.g., fetching an image from a user-provided URL).
     2. The attacker provides a crafted URL pointing to an internal resource (e.g., `http://localhost/admin` or a metadata service like `http://169.254.169.254` in cloud environments).
     3. The server makes the request, potentially exposing internal resources or executing unintended actions.

**3. SSRF Attack Vectors:**
   - **Accessing Internal Services:** SSRF can be used to access internal APIs, admin panels, or databases that are otherwise inaccessible from the outside.
   - **Bypassing Firewalls:** By making requests through the server, attackers can bypass firewall rules that block direct access to certain resources.
   - **Cloud Exploitation:** In cloud environments, SSRF can be used to access metadata services, retrieve sensitive information (like AWS credentials), and escalate privileges.

**4. Mitigating SSRF:**
   - **Input Validation:** Implement strict validation on user inputs that are used to construct URLs, ensuring that only safe and intended destinations are allowed.
   - **Whitelist IPs/Domains:** Only allow the server to make requests to a controlled set of IPs or domains.
   - **Use SSRF-Proof Libraries:** Some libraries and frameworks offer SSRF protection by limiting the destinations to which requests can be made.
   - **Network Segmentation:** Isolate sensitive internal services and ensure they are not accessible from the application server's network.

**5. SSRF Example:**
   - An attacker submits a URL like:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/admin
     ```
   - The server, trusting the URL, accesses the admin panel, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing further attacks.
